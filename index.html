        <h1>The Missing Tennis Ball</h1>
        <h2>by Lejla Mr. Berg's 7th period</h2>
        <p>This is the <strong>beginning</strong> of the story.</p>
        <p>Many people do not know this but I am a lifeguard at a water playground and pool in the Northern Suburbs of Chicago.</p>
        <p>There is a constant joke that goes around the office and guard break room that we hide peoples things just to mess with them and then once they come on break, they end up being super duper confused and it is just a good time.</p>
        <p>One thing that is commonly hidden from our managers by the lifeguards is the tennis ball they use for zone evaluations.</p>
        <p>Basically what this tennis ball does is that our manager will throw it in a pool and the guard on chair for that zone has to stand up and point it out. It is solely to see how long it takes us to point out something if we are correctly scanning the water.</p>
        <p>This tennis ball has this annoying little face on it and the fact that it determines the grade that all the guards get on their certification annoys many of us so that is why a ton of us hide it.</p>
